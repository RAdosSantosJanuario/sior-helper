These campaigns are often specifically targeted against people who, due to job roles and/or accesses, can carry out the adversary\u2019s goal.\u202f\u202f </p>\n\n<p>Impersonation is typically preceded by reconnaissance techniques such as <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1589\">Gather Victim Identity Information</a> and <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1591\">Gather Victim Org Information</a> as well as acquiring infrastructure such as email domains (i.e. <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/001\">Domains</a>) to substantiate their false identity.(Citation: CrowdStrike-BEC)</p>\n\n<p>There is the potential for multiple victims in campaigns involving impersonation.

Many cloud environments allow administrators to grant user or service accounts permission to request just-in-time access to roles, impersonate other accounts, pass roles onto resources and services, or otherwise gain short-term access to a set of privileges that may be distinct from their own. </p>\n\n<p>Just-in-time access is a mechanism for granting additional roles to cloud accounts in a granular, temporary manner. This allows accounts to operate with only the permissions they need on a daily basis, and to request additional permissions as necessary. Sometimes just-in-time access requests are configured to require manual approval, while other times the desired permissions are automatically granted.(Citation: Azure Just in Time Access 2023)</p>\n\n<p>Account impersonation allows user or service accounts to temporarily act with the permissions of another account. For example, in GCP users with the <code>iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator</code> role can create temporary access tokens or sign arbitrary payloads with the permissions of a service account, while service accounts with domain-wide delegation permission are permitted to impersonate Google Workspace accounts.(Citation: Google Cloud Service Account Authentication Roles)(Citation: Hunters Domain Wide Delegation Google Workspace 2023)(Citation: Google Cloud Just in Time Access 2023)(Citation: Palo Alto Unit 42 Google Workspace Domain Wide Delegation 2023) In Exchange Online, the <code>ApplicationImpersonation</code> role allows a service account to use the permissions associated with specified user accounts.(Citation: Microsoft Impersonation and EWS in Exchange) </p>\n\n<p>Many cloud environments also include mechanisms for users to pass roles to resources that allow them to perform tasks and authenticate to other services. While the user that creates the resource does not directly assume the role they pass to it, they may still be able to take advantage of the role's access -- for example, by configuring the resource to perform certain actions with the permissions it has been granted. In AWS, users with the <code>PassRole</code> permission can allow a service they create to assume a given role, while in GCP, users with the <code>iam.serviceAccountUser</code> role can attach a service account to a resource.(Citation: AWS PassRole)(Citation: Google Cloud Service Account Authentication Roles)</p>\n\n<p>While users require specific role assignments in order to use any of these features, cloud administrators may misconfigure permissions. This could result in escalation paths that allow adversaries to gain access to resources beyond what was originally intended.(Citation: Rhino Google Cloud Privilege Escalation)(Citation: Rhino Security Labs AWS Privilege Escalation)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> this technique is distinct from <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/003\">Additional Cloud Roles</a>, which involves assigning permanent roles to accounts rather than abusing existing permissions structures to gain temporarily elevated access to resources. However, adversaries that compromise a sufficiently privileged account may grant another account they control <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/003\">Additional Cloud Roles</a> that would allow them to also abuse these features.

These can be maintained in a number of ways. For example, Azure AD includes three options for synchronizing identities between Active Directory and Azure AD(Citation: Azure AD Hybrid Identity):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Password Hash Synchronization (PHS), in which a privileged on-premises account synchronizes user password hashes between Active Directory and Azure AD, allowing authentication to Azure AD to take place entirely in the cloud </li>\n<li>Pass Through Authentication (PTA), in which Azure AD authentication attempts are forwarded to an on-premises PTA agent, which validates the credentials against Active Directory </li>\n<li>Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), in which a trust relationship is established between Active Directory and Azure AD </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>AD FS can also be used with other SaaS and cloud platforms such as AWS and GCP, which will hand off the authentication process to AD FS and receive a token containing the hybrid users\u2019 identity and privileges. </p>\n\n<p>By modifying authentication processes tied to hybrid identities, an adversary may be able to establish persistent privileged access to cloud resources. For example, adversaries who compromise an on-premises server running a PTA agent may inject a malicious DLL into the <code>AzureADConnectAuthenticationAgentService</code> process that authorizes all attempts to authenticate to Azure AD, as well as records user credentials.(Citation: Azure AD Connect for Read Teamers)(Citation: AADInternals Azure AD On-Prem to Cloud) In environments using AD FS, an adversary may edit the <code>Microsoft.IdentityServer.Servicehost</code> configuration file to load a malicious DLL that generates authentication tokens for any user with any set of claims, thereby bypassing multi-factor authentication and defined AD FS policies.(Citation: MagicWeb)</p>\n\n<p>In some cases, adversaries may be able to modify the hybrid identity authentication process from the cloud. For example, adversaries who compromise a Global Administrator account in an Azure AD tenant may be able to register a new PTA agent via the web console, similarly allowing them to harvest credentials and log into the Azure AD environment as any user.(Citation: Mandiant Azure AD Backdoors)</p>\n", "external_references": [{"source_name": "mitre-attack", "url": "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/007", "external_id": "T1556.007"}, {"url": "<p><a href=\"https://blog.xpnsec.com/azuread-connect-for-redteam/\">Azure AD Connect for Read Teamers</a></p>\n", "description": "Adam Chester.

Adversaries may change this file in storage, to be loaded in a future boot, or in memory during runtime.</p>\n\n<p>To change the operating system in storage, the adversary will typically use the standard procedures available to device operators. This may involve downloading a new file via typical protocols used on network devices, such as TFTP, FTP, SCP, or a console connection.  The original file may be overwritten, or a new file may be written alongside of it and the device reconfigured to boot to the compromised image.</p>\n\n<p>To change the operating system in memory, the adversary typically can use one of two methods. In the first, the adversary would make use of native debug commands in the original, unaltered running operating system that allow them to directly modify the relevant memory addresses containing the running operating system.  This method typically requires administrative level access to the device.</p>\n\n<p>In the second method for changing the operating system in memory, the adversary would make use of the boot loader. The boot loader is the first piece of software that loads when the device starts that, in turn, will launch the operating system.  Adversaries may use malicious code previously implanted in the boot loader, such as through the <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/004\">ROMMONkit</a> method, to directly manipulate running operating system code in memory.  This malicious code in the bootloader provides the capability of direct memory manipulation to the adversary, allowing them to patch the live operating system during runtime.</p>\n\n<p>By modifying the instructions stored in the system image file, adversaries may either weaken existing defenses or provision new capabilities that the device did not have before. Examples of existing defenses that can be impeded include encryption, via <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1600\">Weaken Encryption</a>, authentication, via <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/004\">Network Device Authentication</a>, and perimeter defenses, via <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1599\">Network Boundary Bridging</a>.  Adding new capabilities for the adversary\u2019s purpose include <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/001\">Keylogging</a>, <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/003\">Multi-hop Proxy</a>, and <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/001\">Port Knocking</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Adversaries may also compromise existing commands in the operating system to produce false output to mislead defenders.   When this method is used in conjunction with <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/002\">Downgrade System Image</a>, one example of a compromised system command may include changing the output of the command that shows the version of the currently running operating system.  By patching the operating system, the adversary can change this command to instead display the original, higher revision number that they replaced through the system downgrade. </p>\n\n<p>When the operating system is patched in storage, this can be achieved in either the resident storage (typically a form of flash memory, which is non-volatile) or via <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/005\">TFTP Boot</a>. </p>\n\n<p>When the technique is performed on the running operating system in memory and not on the stored copy, this technique will not survive across reboots.

Spearphishing for information is an attempt to trick targets into divulging information, frequently credentials or other actionable information. Spearphishing for information frequently involves social engineering techniques, such as posing as a source with a reason to collect information (ex: <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1585\">Establish Accounts</a> or <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1586\">Compromise Accounts</a>) and/or sending multiple, seemingly urgent messages.</p>\n\n<p>All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, the malicious emails contain links generally accompanied by social engineering text to coax the user to actively click or copy and paste a URL into a browser.(Citation: TrendMictro Phishing)(Citation: PCMag FakeLogin) The given website may be a clone of a legitimate site (such as an online or corporate login portal) or may closely resemble a legitimate site in appearance and have a URL containing elements from the real site. URLs may also be obfuscated by taking advantage of quirks in the URL schema, such as the acceptance of integer- or hexadecimal-based hostname formats and the automatic discarding of text before an \u201c@\u201d symbol: for example, <code>hxxp://google.com@1157586937</code>.(Citation: Mandiant URL Obfuscation 2023)</p>\n\n<p>Adversaries may also embed \u201ctracking pixels\u201d, \"web bugs\", or \"web beacons\" within phishing messages to verify the receipt of an email, while also potentially profiling and tracking victim information such as IP address.(Citation: NIST Web Bug) (Citation: Ryte Wiki) These mechanisms often appear as small images (typically one pixel in size) or otherwise obfuscated objects and are typically delivered as HTML code containing a link to a remote server. (Citation: Ryte Wiki)(Citation: IAPP)</p>\n\n<p>Adversaries may also be able to spoof a complete website using what is known as a \"browser-in-the-browser\" (BitB) attack. By generating a fake browser popup window with an HTML-based address bar that appears to contain a legitimate URL (such as an authentication portal), they may be able to prompt users to enter their credentials while bypassing typical URL verification methods.(Citation: ZScaler BitB 2020)(Citation: Mr. D0x BitB 2022)</p>\n\n<p>Adversaries can use phishing kits such as <code>EvilProxy</code> and <code>Evilginx2</code> to perform adversary-in-the-middle phishing by proxying the connection between the victim and the legitimate website. On a successful login, the victim is redirected to the legitimate website, while the adversary captures their session cookie (i.e., <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1539\">Steal Web Session Cookie</a>) in addition to their username and password. This may enable the adversary to then bypass MFA via <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/004\">Web Session Cookie</a>.(Citation: Proofpoint Human Factor)</p>\n\n<p>Adversaries may also send a malicious link in the form of Quick Response (QR) Codes (also known as \u201cquishing\u201d). These links may direct a victim to a credential phishing page.(Citation: QR-campaign-energy-firm) By using a QR code, the URL may not be exposed in the email and may thus go undetected by most automated email security scans.(Citation: qr-phish-agriculture) These QR codes may be scanned by or delivered directly  to a user\u2019s mobile device (i.e., <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1660\">Phishing</a>), which may be less secure in several relevant ways.(Citation: qr-phish-agriculture) For example, mobile users may not be able to notice minor differences between genuine and credential harvesting websites due to mobile\u2019s smaller form factor.</p>\n\n<p>From the fake website, information is gathered in web forms and sent to the adversary.

For example, AWS provides a <code>DescribeInstances</code> API within the Amazon EC2 API that can return information about one or more instances within an account, the <code>ListBuckets</code> API that returns a list of all buckets owned by the authenticated sender of the request, the <code>HeadBucket</code> API to determine a bucket\u2019s existence along with access permissions of the request sender, or the <code>GetPublicAccessBlock</code> API to retrieve access block configuration for a bucket.(Citation: Amazon Describe Instance)(Citation: Amazon Describe Instances API)(Citation: AWS Get Public Access Block)(Citation: AWS Head Bucket) Similarly, GCP's Cloud SDK CLI provides the <code>gcloud compute instances list</code> command to list all Google Compute Engine instances in a project (Citation: Google Compute Instances), and Azure's CLI command <code>az vm list</code> lists details of virtual machines.(Citation: Microsoft AZ CLI) In addition to API commands, adversaries can utilize open source tools to discover cloud storage infrastructure through <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1595/003\">Wordlist Scanning</a>.(Citation: Malwarebytes OSINT Leaky Buckets - Hioureas)</p>\n\n<p>An adversary may enumerate resources using a compromised user's access keys to determine which are available to that user.(Citation: Expel IO Evil in AWS) The discovery of these available resources may help adversaries determine their next steps in the Cloud environment, such as establishing Persistence.(Citation: Mandiant M-Trends 2020)An adversary may also use this information to change the configuration to make the bucket publicly accessible, allowing data to be accessed without authentication. Adversaries have also may use infrastructure discovery APIs such as <code>DescribeDBInstances</code> to determine size, owner, permissions, and network ACLs of database resources. (Citation: AWS Describe DB Instances) Adversaries can use this information to determine the potential value of databases and discover the requirements to access them.

Spearphishing with a link is a specific variant of spearphishing. It is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of links to download malware contained in email, instead of attaching malicious files to the email itself, to avoid defenses that may inspect email attachments. Spearphishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source.</p>\n\n<p>All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this case, the malicious emails contain links. Generally, the links will be accompanied by social engineering text and require the user to actively click or copy and paste a URL into a browser, leveraging <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204\">User Execution</a>. The visited website may compromise the web browser using an exploit, or the user will be prompted to download applications, documents, zip files, or even executables depending on the pretext for the email in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Adversaries may also include links that are intended to interact directly with an email reader, including embedded images intended to exploit the end system directly. Additionally, adversaries may use seemingly benign links that abuse special characters to mimic legitimate websites (known as an \"IDN homograph attack\").(Citation: CISA IDN ST05-016) URLs may also be obfuscated by taking advantage of quirks in the URL schema, such as the acceptance of integer- or hexadecimal-based hostname formats and the automatic discarding of text before an \u201c@\u201d symbol: for example, <code>hxxp://google.com@1157586937</code>.(Citation: Mandiant URL Obfuscation 2023)</p>\n\n<p>Adversaries may also utilize links to perform consent phishing, typically with OAuth 2.0 request URLs that when accepted by the user provide permissions/access for malicious applications, allowing adversaries to  <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1528\">Steal Application Access Token</a>s.(Citation: Trend Micro Pawn Storm OAuth 2017) These stolen access tokens allow the adversary to perform various actions on behalf of the user via API calls. (Citation: Microsoft OAuth 2.0 Consent Phishing 2021)</p>\n\n<p>Adversaries may also utilize spearphishing links to <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1528\">Steal Application Access Token</a>s that grant immediate access to the victim environment.

The SSL/TLS protocol suite includes mechanisms for the client and server to agree on an encryption algorithm to use for subsequent secure connections. If SSL renegotiation is enabled, a request can be made for renegotiation of the crypto algorithm. In a renegotiation attack, the adversary establishes a SSL/TLS connection and then proceeds to make a series of renegotiation requests.

A system's OS is responsible for managing the finite resources as well as preventing the entire system from being overwhelmed by excessive demands on its capacity. These attacks do not need to exhaust the actual resources on a system; the attacks may simply exhaust the limits and available resources that an OS self-imposes.</p>\n\n<p>Different ways to achieve this exist, including TCP state-exhaustion attacks such as SYN floods and ACK floods.(Citation: Arbor AnnualDoSreport Jan 2018) With SYN floods, excessive amounts of SYN packets are sent, but the 3-way TCP handshake is never completed. Because each OS has a maximum number of concurrent TCP connections that it will allow, this can quickly exhaust the ability of the system to receive new requests for TCP connections, thus preventing access to any TCP service provided by the server.(Citation: Cloudflare SynFlood)</p>\n\n<p>ACK floods leverage the stateful nature of the TCP protocol. A flood of ACK packets are sent to the target. This forces the OS to search its state table for a related TCP connection that has already been established. Because the ACK packets are for connections that do not exist, the OS will have to search the entire state table to confirm that no match exists. When it is necessary to do this for a large flood of packets, the computational requirements can cause the server to become sluggish and/or unresponsive, due to the work it must do to eliminate the rogue ACK packets.

The KDC is responsible for both authentication and ticket granting.  Adversaries may attempt to abuse Kerberos by stealing tickets or forging tickets to enable unauthorized access.</p>\n\n<p>On Windows, the built-in <code>klist</code> utility can be used to list and analyze cached Kerberos tickets.(Citation: Microsoft Klist)</p>\n\n<p>Linux systems on Active Directory domains store Kerberos credentials locally in the credential cache file referred to as the \"ccache\". The credentials are stored in the ccache file while they remain valid and generally while a user's session lasts.(Citation: MIT ccache) On modern Redhat Enterprise Linux systems, and derivative distributions, the System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) handles Kerberos tickets. By default SSSD maintains a copy of the ticket database that can be found in <code>/var/lib/sss/secrets/secrets.ldb</code> as well as the corresponding key located in <code>/var/lib/sss/secrets/.secrets.mkey</code>. Both files require root access to read. If an adversary is able to access the database and key, the credential cache Kerberos blob can be extracted and converted into a usable Kerberos ccache file that adversaries may use for <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/003\">Pass the Ticket</a>. The ccache file may also be converted into a Windows format using tools such as Kekeo.(Citation: Linux Kerberos Tickets)(Citation: Brining MimiKatz to Unix)(Citation: Kekeo)</p>\n\n<p>Kerberos tickets on macOS are stored in a standard ccache format, similar to Linux. By default, access to these ccache entries is federated through the KCM daemon process via the Mach RPC protocol, which uses the caller's environment to determine access. The storage location for these ccache entries is influenced by the <code>/etc/krb5.conf</code> configuration file and the <code>KRB5CCNAME</code> environment variable which can specify to save them to disk or keep them protected via the KCM daemon. Users can interact with ticket storage using <code>kinit</code>, <code>klist</code>, <code>ktutil</code>, and <code>kcc</code> built-in binaries or via Apple's native Kerberos framework. Adversaries can use open source tools to interact with the ccache files directly or to use the Kerberos framework to call lower-level APIs for extracting the user's TGT or Service Tickets.(Citation: SpectorOps Bifrost Kerberos macOS 2019)(Citation: macOS kerberos framework MIT)</p>\n", "external_references": [{"source_name": "mitre-attack", "url": "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558", "external_id": "T1558"}, {"url": "<p><a href=\"https://cert.europa.eu/static/WhitePapers/UPDATED%20-%20CERT-EU_Security_Whitepaper_2014-007_Kerberos_Golden_Ticket_Protection_v1_4.pdf\">CERT-EU Golden Ticket Protection</a></p>\n", "description": "Abolins, D., Boldea, C., Socha, K., Soria-Machado, M.

This Registry value could also be redirected to a suitable exported function from an already present DLL, avoiding the requirement to drop and execute a new file on disk.</li>\n<li>Modifying the <code>DLL</code> and <code>Function</code> Registry values in <code>HKLM\\SOFTWARE[WOW6432Node]Microsoft\\Cryptography\\Providers\\Trust\\FinalPolicy{trust provider GUID}</code> that point to the DLL providing a trust provider\u2019s FinalPolicy function, which is where the decoded and parsed signature is checked and the majority of trust decisions are made. Similar to hijacking SIP\u2019s CryptSIPDllVerifyIndirectData function, this value can be redirected to a suitable exported function from an already present DLL or a maliciously-crafted DLL (though the implementation of a trust provider is complex).</li>\n<li><strong>Note:</strong> The above hijacks are also possible without modifying the Registry via <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001\">DLL Search Order Hijacking</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Hijacking SIP or trust provider components can also enable persistent code execution, since these malicious components may be invoked by any application that performs code signing or signature validation.

These frameworks are used collaboratively to verify the user and determine what actions the user is allowed to perform. Once identity is established, the token allows actions to be authorized, without passing the actual credentials of the user. Therefore, compromise of the token can grant the adversary access to resources of other sites through a malicious application.(Citation: okta)</p>\n\n<p>For example, with a cloud-based email service, once an OAuth access token is granted to a malicious application, it can potentially gain long-term access to features of the user account if a \"refresh\" token enabling background access is awarded.(Citation: Microsoft Identity Platform Access 2019) With an OAuth access token an adversary can use the user-granted REST API to perform functions such as email searching and contact enumeration.(Citation: Staaldraad Phishing with OAuth 2017)</p>\n\n<p>Compromised access tokens may be used as an initial step in compromising other services. For example, if a token grants access to a victim\u2019s primary email, the adversary may be able to extend access to all other services which the target subscribes by triggering forgotten password routines.

Adversaries may do this to execute commands as other users or spawn processes with higher privileges.</p>\n\n<p>Within Linux and MacOS systems, sudo (sometimes referred to as \"superuser do\") allows users to perform commands from terminals with elevated privileges and to control who can perform these commands on the system. The <code>sudo</code> command \"allows a system administrator to delegate authority to give certain users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands as root or another user while providing an audit trail of the commands and their arguments.\"(Citation: sudo man page 2018) Since sudo was made for the system administrator, it has some useful configuration features such as a <code>timestamp<em>timeout</code>, which is the amount of time in minutes between instances of <code>sudo</code> before it will re-prompt for a password. This is because <code>sudo</code> has the ability to cache credentials for a period of time. Sudo creates (or touches) a file at <code>/var/db/sudo</code> with a timestamp of when sudo was last run to determine this timeout. Additionally, there is a <code>tty</em>tickets</code> variable that treats each new tty (terminal session) in isolation. This means that, for example, the sudo timeout of one tty will not affect another tty (you will have to type the password again).</p>\n\n<p>The sudoers file, <code>/etc/sudoers</code>, describes which users can run which commands and from which terminals. This also describes which commands users can run as other users or groups. This provides the principle of least privilege such that users are running in their lowest possible permissions for most of the time and only elevate to other users or permissions as needed, typically by prompting for a password. However, the sudoers file can also specify when to not prompt users for passwords with a line like <code>user1 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL</code>.(Citation: OSX.Dok Malware) Elevated privileges are required to edit this file though.</p>\n\n<p>Adversaries can also abuse poor configurations of these mechanisms to escalate privileges without needing the user's password.

Windows User Account Control (UAC) allows a program to elevate its privileges (tracked as integrity levels ranging from low to high) to perform a task under administrator-level permissions, possibly by prompting the user for confirmation.

User <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/004\">Unix Shell</a>s execute several configuration scripts at different points throughout the session based on events. For example, when a user opens a command-line interface or remotely logs in (such as via SSH) a login shell is initiated. The login shell executes scripts from the system (<code>/etc</code>) and the user\u2019s home directory (<code>~/</code>) to configure the environment. All login shells on a system use /etc/profile when initiated. These configuration scripts run at the permission level of their directory and are often used to set environment variables, create aliases, and customize the user\u2019s environment. When the shell exits or terminates, additional shell scripts are executed to ensure the shell exits appropriately. </p>\n\n<p>Adversaries may attempt to establish persistence by inserting commands into scripts automatically executed by shells. Using bash as an example, the default shell for most GNU/Linux systems, adversaries may add commands that launch malicious binaries into the <code>/etc/profile</code> and <code>/etc/profile.d</code> files.(Citation: intezer-kaiji-malware)(Citation: bencane blog bashrc) These files typically require root permissions to modify and are executed each time any shell on a system launches. For user level permissions, adversaries can insert malicious commands into <code>~/.bash<em>profile</code>, <code>~/.bash</em>login</code>, or <code>~/.profile</code> which are sourced when a user opens a command-line interface or connects remotely.(Citation: anomali-rocke-tactics)(Citation: Linux manual bash invocation) Since the system only executes the first existing file in the listed order, adversaries have used <code>~/.bash<em>profile</code> to ensure execution. Adversaries have also leveraged the <code>~/.bashrc</code> file which is additionally executed if the connection is established remotely or an additional interactive shell is opened, such as a new tab in the command-line interface.(Citation: Tsunami)(Citation: anomali-rocke-tactics)(Citation: anomali-linux-rabbit)(Citation: Magento) Some malware targets the termination of a program to trigger execution, adversaries can use the <code>~/.bash</em>logout</code> file to execute malicious commands at the end of a session. </p>\n\n<p>For macOS, the functionality of this technique is similar but may leverage zsh, the default shell for macOS 10.15+. When the Terminal.app is opened, the application launches a zsh login shell and a zsh interactive shell. The login shell configures the system environment using <code>/etc/profile</code>, <code>/etc/zshenv</code>, <code>/etc/zprofile</code>, and <code>/etc/zlogin</code>.(Citation: ScriptingOSX zsh)(Citation: PersistentJXA<em>leopitt)(Citation: code</em>persistence_zsh)(Citation: macOS MS office sandbox escape) The login shell then configures the user environment with <code>~/.zprofile</code> and <code>~/.zlogin</code>. The interactive shell uses the <code>~/.zshrc</code> to configure the user environment. Upon exiting, <code>/etc/zlogout</code> and <code>~/.zlogout</code> are executed. For legacy programs, macOS executes <code>/etc/bashrc</code> on startup.</p>\n", "external_references": [{"source_name": "mitre-attack", "url": "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/004", "external_id": "T1546.004"}, {"url": "<p><a href=\"https://www.intezer.com/blog/research/kaiji-new-chinese-linux-malware-turning-to-golang/\">intezer-kaiji-malware</a></p>\n", "description": "Paul Litvak.

DLL injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.  </p>\n\n<p>DLL injection is commonly performed by writing the path to a DLL in the virtual address space of the target process before loading the DLL by invoking a new thread. The write can be performed with native Windows API calls such as <code>VirtualAllocEx</code> and <code>WriteProcessMemory</code>, then invoked with <code>CreateRemoteThread</code> (which calls the <code>LoadLibrary</code> API responsible for loading the DLL). (Citation: Elastic Process Injection July 2017) </p>\n\n<p>Variations of this method such as reflective DLL injection (writing a self-mapping DLL into a process) and memory module (map DLL when writing into process) overcome the address relocation issue as well as the additional APIs to invoke execution (since these methods load and execute the files in memory by manually preforming the function of <code>LoadLibrary</code>).(Citation: Elastic HuntingNMemory June 2017)(Citation: Elastic Process Injection July 2017) </p>\n\n<p>Another variation of this method, often referred to as Module Stomping/Overloading or DLL Hollowing, may be leveraged to conceal injected code within a process.

If a container is compromised, an adversary may be able to steal the container\u2019s token and thereby gain access to Kubernetes API commands.(Citation: Kubernetes Service Accounts)  Similarly, instances within continuous-development / continuous-integration (CI/CD) pipelines will often use API tokens to authenticate to other services for testing and deployment.(Citation: Cider Security Top 10 CICD Security Risks) If these pipelines are compromised, adversaries may be able to steal these tokens and leverage their privileges.</p>\n\n<p>Token theft can also occur through social engineering, in which case user action may be required to grant access. OAuth is one commonly implemented framework that issues tokens to users for access to systems. An application desiring access to cloud-based services or protected APIs can gain entry using OAuth 2.0 through a variety of authorization protocols. An example commonly-used sequence is Microsoft's Authorization Code Grant flow.(Citation: Microsoft Identity Platform Protocols May 2019)(Citation: Microsoft - OAuth Code Authorization flow - June 2019) An OAuth access token enables a third-party application to interact with resources containing user data in the ways requested by the application without obtaining user credentials. </p>\n\n<p>Adversaries can leverage OAuth authorization by constructing a malicious application designed to be granted access to resources with the target user's OAuth token.(Citation: Amnesty OAuth Phishing Attacks, August 2019)(Citation: Trend Micro Pawn Storm OAuth 2017) The adversary will need to complete registration of their application with the authorization server, for example Microsoft Identity Platform using Azure Portal, the Visual Studio IDE, the command-line interface, PowerShell, or REST API calls.(Citation: Microsoft - Azure AD App Registration - May 2019) Then, they can send a <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002\">Spearphishing Link</a> to the target user to entice them to grant access to the application.

Endpoint DoS can be performed by exhausting the system resources those services are hosted on or exploiting the system to cause a persistent crash condition. Example services include websites, email services, DNS, and web-based applications. Adversaries have been observed conducting DoS attacks for political purposes(Citation: FireEye OpPoisonedHandover February 2016) and to support other malicious activities, including distraction(Citation: FSISAC FraudNetDoS September 2012), hacktivism, and extortion.(Citation: Symantec DDoS October 2014)</p>\n\n<p>An Endpoint DoS denies the availability of a service without saturating the network used to provide access to the service. Adversaries can target various layers of the application stack that is hosted on the system used to provide the service. These layers include the Operating Systems (OS), server applications such as web servers, DNS servers, databases, and the (typically web-based) applications that sit on top of them. Attacking each layer requires different techniques that take advantage of bottlenecks that are unique to the respective components. A DoS attack may be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS (DDoS).</p>\n\n<p>To perform DoS attacks against endpoint resources, several aspects apply to multiple methods, including IP address spoofing and botnets.</p>\n\n<p>Adversaries may use the original IP address of an attacking system, or spoof the source IP address to make the attack traffic more difficult to trace back to the attacking system or to enable reflection. This can increase the difficulty defenders have in defending against the attack by reducing or eliminating the effectiveness of filtering by the source address on network defense devices.</p>\n\n<p>Botnets are commonly used to conduct DDoS attacks against networks and services. Large botnets can generate a significant amount of traffic from systems spread across the global internet. Adversaries may have the resources to build out and control their own botnet infrastructure or may rent time on an existing botnet to conduct an attack. In some of the worst cases for DDoS, so many systems are used to generate requests that each one only needs to send out a small amount of traffic to produce enough volume to exhaust the target's resources. In such circumstances, distinguishing DDoS traffic from legitimate clients becomes exceedingly difficult. Botnets have been used in some of the most high-profile DDoS attacks, such as the 2012 series of incidents that targeted major US banks.(Citation: USNYAG IranianBotnet March 2016)</p>\n\n<p>In cases where traffic manipulation is used, there may be points in the global network (such as high traffic gateway routers) where packets can be altered and cause legitimate clients to execute code that directs network packets toward a target in high volume. This type of capability was previously used for the purposes of web censorship where client HTTP traffic was modified to include a reference to JavaScript that generated the DDoS code to overwhelm target web servers.(Citation: ArsTechnica Great Firewall of China)</p>\n\n<p>For attacks attempting to saturate the providing network, see <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498\">Network Denial of Service</a>.</p>\n", "external_references": [{"source_name": "mitre-attack", "url": "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499", "external_id": "T1499"}, {"url": "<p><a href=\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/netflow/configuration/15-mt/nf-15-mt-book/nf-detct-analy-thrts.pdf\">Cisco DoSdetectNetflow</a></p>\n", "description": "Cisco.

There are several known examples of this occurring.(Citation: Shadowserver Strategic Web Compromise)</p>\n\n<p>Typical drive-by compromise process:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A user visits a website that is used to host the adversary controlled content.</li>\n<li>Scripts automatically execute, typically searching versions of the browser and plugins for a potentially vulnerable version. \n<ul>\n<li>The user may be required to assist in this process by enabling scripting or active website components and ignoring warning dialog boxes.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Upon finding a vulnerable version, exploit code is delivered to the browser.</li>\n<li>If exploitation is successful, then it will give the adversary code execution on the user's system unless other protections are in place.\n<ul>\n<li>In some cases a second visit to the website after the initial scan is required before exploit code is delivered.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Unlike <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190\">Exploit Public-Facing Application</a>, the focus of this technique is to exploit software on a client endpoint upon visiting a website. This will commonly give an adversary access to systems on the internal network instead of external systems that may be in a DMZ.</p>\n\n<p>Adversaries may also use compromised websites to deliver a user to a malicious application designed to <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1528\">Steal Application Access Token</a>s, like OAuth tokens, to gain access to protected applications and information.

Traffic signaling involves the use of a magic value or sequence that must be sent to a system to trigger a special response, such as opening a closed port or executing a malicious task. This may take the form of sending a series of packets with certain characteristics before a port will be opened that the adversary can use for command and control. Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports (i.e. <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/001\">Port Knocking</a>), but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics. After the sequence is completed, opening a port may be accomplished by the host-based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.</p>\n\n<p>Adversaries may also communicate with an already open port, but the service listening on that port will only respond to commands or trigger other malicious functionality if passed the appropriate magic value(s).</p>\n\n<p>The observation of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted through different methods. One means, originally implemented by Cd00r (Citation: Hartrell cd00r 2002), is to use the libpcap libraries to sniff for the packets in question. Another method leverages raw sockets, which enables the malware to use ports that are already open for use by other programs.</p>\n\n<p>On network devices, adversaries may use crafted packets to enable <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/004\">Network Device Authentication</a> for standard services offered by the device such as telnet.  Such signaling may also be used to open a closed service port such as telnet, or to trigger module modification of malware implants on the device, adding, removing, or changing malicious capabilities.  Adversaries may use crafted packets to attempt to connect to one or more (open or closed) ports, but may also attempt to connect to a router interface, broadcast, and network address IP on the same port in order to achieve their goals and objectives.(Citation: Cisco Synful Knock Evolution)(Citation: Mandiant - Synful Knock)(Citation: Cisco Blog Legacy Device Attacks)  To enable this traffic signaling on embedded devices, adversaries must first achieve and leverage <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/001\">Patch System Image</a> due to the monolithic nature of the architecture.</p>\n\n<p>Adversaries may also use the Wake-on-LAN feature to turn on powered off systems.

Use of MFA is recommended and provides a higher level of security than usernames and passwords alone, but organizations should be aware of techniques that could be used to intercept and bypass these security mechanisms. </p>\n\n<p>If a smart card is used for multi-factor authentication, then a keylogger will need to be used to obtain the password associated with a smart card during normal use. With both an inserted card and access to the smart card password, an adversary can connect to a network resource using the infected system to proxy the authentication with the inserted hardware token. (Citation: Mandiant M Trends 2011)</p>\n\n<p>Adversaries may also employ a keylogger to similarly target other hardware tokens, such as RSA SecurID. Capturing token input (including a user's personal identification code) may provide temporary access (i.e. replay the one-time passcode until the next value rollover) as well as possibly enabling adversaries to reliably predict future authentication values (given access to both the algorithm and any seed values used to generate appended temporary codes). (Citation: GCN RSA June 2011)</p>\n\n<p>Other methods of MFA may be intercepted and used by an adversary to authenticate. It is common for one-time codes to be sent via out-of-band communications (email, SMS). If the device and/or service is not secured, then it may be vulnerable to interception.

Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Security constructs such as permission levels will often hinder access to information and use of certain techniques, so adversaries will likely need to perform privilege escalation to include use of software exploitation to circumvent those restrictions.</p>\n\n<p>When initially gaining access to a system, an adversary may be operating within a lower privileged process which will prevent them from accessing certain resources on the system. Vulnerabilities may exist, usually in operating system components and software commonly running at higher permissions, that can be exploited to gain higher levels of access on the system. This could enable someone to move from unprivileged or user level permissions to SYSTEM or root permissions depending on the component that is vulnerable. This could also enable an adversary to move from a virtualized environment, such as within a virtual machine or container, onto the underlying host. This may be a necessary step for an adversary compromising an endpoint system that has been properly configured and limits other privilege escalation methods.</p>\n\n<p>Adversaries may bring a signed vulnerable driver onto a compromised machine so that they can exploit the vulnerability to execute code in kernel mode.

If another certificate is presented, it could indicate device compromise, traffic interception, or another upstream issue. While benign usages are common, it is also possible for adversaries to abuse this technology to protect malicious C2 traffic.</p>\n\n<p>In normal, not pinned SSL validation, when a client connects to a server using HTTPS, it typically checks whether the server\u2019s SSL/TLS certificate is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) in the device\u2019s trust store. If the certificate is valid and signed by a trusted CA, the connection is established. However, with <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1521/003\">SSL Pinning</a> , the client is configured to trust a specific SSL/TLS certificate or public key, rather than relying on the device\u2019s trust store.

This approach also works with self-signed certificates.</p></li>\n<li><p>Public Key Pinning: Instead of pinning the entire certificate, the client pins just the public key extracted from the certificate. This is often more flexible, as it allows the server to renew its certificate without having to update the pinned certificate or breaking the SSL connection.</p></li>\n</ol>\n", "external_references": [{"source_name": "mitre-attack", "url": "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1521/003", "external_id": "T1521.003"}], "detections": {"att&ck": [], "d3fend": [], "sigma": [], "guardsight": []}, "mitigations": [], "related_relationships": [], "responses": {"d3fend": [], "guardsight": []}, "tests": {"atomic": []}}, {"type": "attack-pattern", "id": "attack-pattern--be63612f-a48f-44f2-a7a6-1763509fcf80", "technique_id": "T1422.002", "parent_id": "T1422", "kill_chain_phases": [{"kill_chain_name": "mitre-mobile-attack", "phase_name": "discovery"}], "name": "Wi-Fi Discovery", "description": "<p>Adversaries may search for information about Wi-Fi networks, such as network names and passwords, on compromised systems.

Oftentimes the most valuable exploits to an offensive toolkit are those that can be used to obtain code execution on a remote system because they can be used to gain access to that system. Users will expect to see files related to the applications they commonly used to do work, so they are a useful target for exploit research and development because of their high utility. </p>\n\n<p>Adversaries may use device-based zero-click exploits for code execution. These exploits are powerful because there is no user interaction required for code execution. </p>\n\n<h3>SMS/iMessage Delivery</h3>\n\n<p>SMS and iMessage in iOS are common targets through <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1456\">Drive-By Compromise</a>, <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1660\">Phishing</a>, etc. Adversaries may use embed malicious links, files, etc. in SMS messages or iMessages. Mobile devices may be compromised through one-click exploits, where the victim must interact with a text message, or zero-click exploits, where no user interaction is required. </p>\n\n<h3>AirDrop</h3>\n\n<p>Unique to iOS, AirDrop is a network protocol that allows iOS users to transfer files between iOS devices. Before patches from Apple were released, on iOS 13.4 and earlier, adversaries may force the Apple Wireless Direct Link (AWDL) interface to activate, then exploit a buffer overflow to gain access to the device and run as root without interaction from the user.  </p>\n", "external_references": [{"source_name": "mitre-attack", "url": "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1658", "external_id": "T1658"}], "detections": {"att&ck": [], "d3fend": [], "sigma": [], "guardsight": []}, "mitigations": [], "related_relationships": [], "responses": {"d3fend": [], "guardsight": []}, "tests": {"atomic": []}}, {"type": "attack-pattern", "id": "attack-pattern--114fed8b-7eed-4136-8b9c-411c5c7fff4b", "technique_id": "T1655.001", "parent_id": "T1655", "kill_chain_phases": [{"kill_chain_name": "mitre-mobile-attack", "phase_name": "defense-evasion"}], "name": "Match Legitimate Name or Location", "description": "<p>Adversaries may match or approximate the name or location of legitimate files or resources when naming/placing them.

For example, a malicious application may register itself as a VPN client, effectively redirecting device traffic to adversary-owned resources. Registering as a VPN client requires user consent on both Android and iOS; additionally, a special entitlement granted by Apple is needed for iOS devices. Alternatively, a malicious application with escalation privileges may utilize those privileges to gain access to network traffic.   </p>\n\n<p>Specific to Android devices, adversary-in-the-disk is a type of AiTM attack where adversaries monitor and manipulate data that is exchanged between applications and external storage.(Citation: mitd<em>kaspersky)(Citation: mitd</em>checkpoint)(Citation: mitd<em>checkpoint</em>research) To accomplish this, a malicious application firsts requests for access to multimedia files on the device (<code>READ_EXTERNAL STORAGE</code> and <code>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code>), then the application reads data on the device and/or writes malware to the device. Though the request for access is common, when used maliciously, adversaries may access files and other sensitive data due to abusing the permission. Multiple applications were shown to be vulnerable against this attack; however, scrutiny of permissions and input validations may mitigate this attack.    </p>\n\n<p>Outside of a mobile device, adversaries may be able to capture traffic by employing a rogue base station or Wi-Fi access point. These devices will allow adversaries to capture network traffic after it has left the device, while it is flowing to its destination. On a local network, enterprise techniques could be used, such as <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/002\">ARP Cache Poisoning</a> or <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/003\">DHCP Spoofing</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>If applications properly encrypt their network traffic, sensitive data may not be accessible to adversaries, depending on the point of capture. For example, properly implementing Apple\u2019s Application Transport Security (ATS) and Android\u2019s Network Security Configuration (NSC) may prevent sensitive data leaks.(Citation: NSC_Android)</p>\n", "external_references": [{"source_name": "mitre-attack", "url": "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1638", "external_id": "T1638"}, {"url": "<p><a href=\"https://blog.checkpoint.com/security/man-in-the-disk-a-new-attack-surface-for-android-apps/\">mitd_checkpoint</a></p>\n", "description": "Check Point Research Team.

(Citation: Jos Wetzels, Marina Krotofil 2019)  Methods of suppression often rely on modification of alarm settings, such as modifying in memory code to fixed values or tampering with assembly level instruction code. </p>\n", "external_references": [{"source_name": "mitre-attack", "url": "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0838", "external_id": "T0838"}, {"url": "<p><a href=\"https://troopers.de/downloads/troopers19/TROOPERS19_NGI_IoT_diet_poisoned_fruit.pdf\">Jos Wetzels, Marina Krotofil 2019</a></p>\n", "description": "Jos Wetzels, Marina Krotofil 2019 A Diet of Poisoned Fruit: Designing Implants & OT Payloads for ICS Embedded Devices Retrieved. 2019/11/01 "}], "detections": {"att&ck": [], "d3fend": [], "sigma": [], "guardsight": []}, "mitigations": [], "related_relationships": [], "responses": {"d3fend": [], "guardsight": []}, "tests": {"atomic": []}}, {"type": "attack-pattern", "id": "attack-pattern--efbf7888-f61b-4572-9c80-7e2965c60707", "technique_id": "T0839", "parent_id": null, "kill_chain_phases": [{"kill_chain_name": "mitre-ics-attack", "phase_name": "persistence"}, {"kill_chain_name": "mitre-ics-attack", "phase_name": "impair-process-control"}], "name": "Module Firmware", "description": "<p>Adversaries may install malicious or vulnerable firmware onto modular hardware devices. Control system devices often contain modular hardware devices.

(Citation: Daniel Peck,  Dale Peterson January 2009)  </p>\n\n<p>An easy point of access for an adversary is the Ethernet card, which may have its own CPU, RAM, and operating system. The adversary may attack and likely exploit the computer on an Ethernet card. Exploitation of the Ethernet card computer may enable the adversary to accomplish additional attacks, such as the following: (Citation: Daniel Peck,  Dale Peterson January 2009)  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Delayed Attack - The adversary may stage an attack in advance and choose when to launch it, such as at a particularly damaging time.  </li>\n<li>Brick the Ethernet Card - Malicious firmware may be programmed to result in an Ethernet card failure, requiring a factory return.  </li>\n<li>Random Attack or Failure - The adversary may load malicious firmware onto multiple field devices. Execution of an attack and the time it occurs is generated by a pseudo-random number generator.   </li>\n<li>A Field Device Worm - The adversary may choose to identify all field devices of the same model, with the end goal of performing a device-wide compromise.  </li>\n<li>Attack Other Cards on the Field Device - Although it is not the most important module in a field device, the Ethernet card is most accessible to the adversary and malware. Compromise of the Ethernet card may provide a more direct route to compromising other modules, such as the CPU module.</li>\n</ul>\n", "external_references": [{"source_name": "mitre-attack", "url": "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0839", "external_id": "T0839"}, {"url": "<p><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228849043_Leveraging_ethernet_card_vulnerabilities_in_field_devices\">Daniel Peck,  Dale Peterson January 2009</a></p>\n", "description": "Daniel Peck,  Dale Peterson 2009, January 28 Leveraging Ethernet Card Vulnerabilities in Field Devices Retrieved. 2017/12/19 "}], "detections": {"att&ck": [], "d3fend": [], "sigma": [], "guardsight": []}, "mitigations": [], "related_relationships": [], "responses": {"d3fend": [], "guardsight": []}, "tests": {"atomic": []}}]
